List of changes:
1) SAMPML Format refactoring

- introduce <SpectrumGroup> that regroup all data from the same sample (spectrum, histogram)
- Harmonize defaults value. A missing value is always described as N/A (Non Available)
- Streamlining of the <Analysis> tag (spectrumIDs references the SecptrumGroup Id), clean  <IdedNuclides> and <Nuclide> tags
- Many more little bugs have been corrected

2) Validation using an XSD validator

- The format is described using XSD (see SAMPML.xsd and SAMPML-common.xsd)
- This first version validates SAUNA and SPALAX samples
- Validation and check are automatically performed in the product generation
- This has been heavily tested as 3 months of data have been retrieved and successfully validated

3) product generation and distribution tools refactoring

- An incremental method is now used to find new samples that have not been sent to a particular distribution group
- If the acquisition pipeline is stopped or unavailable for a while, after its restoraiton, the production generation and distribution sfotware will send
  all unsent samples
- Instrumentation to have the possibility to send samples from an older day and to force the resending of any days
